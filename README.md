# AdCode

All of this is ad related, or it makes use of the DFP API to do stuff. These are built to assist my current employer in their day to day tasks and I've made them available to any publishers.

I rarely write anymore scripts as I've moved to a different role, but the DFP Client Library was really great to work with as a beginner.
